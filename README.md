**Brain Tumor Classification with Vision Transformer (ViT)**

This project implements a Vision Transformer (ViT) model for classifying brain tumor images into two categories: yes (tumor present) and no (no tumor). The dataset consists of images categorized into two folders: yes and no.

**Project Structure**

brain_tumor_model.ipynb: Jupyter notebook containing the code for data preparation, model definition, training, and evaluation.
brain_tumor_dataset/: Directory containing the brain tumor dataset organized into yes and no folders.

**Dataset**

The dataset is organized into two folders:

yes: Contains images of brain scans with tumors.
no: Contains images of brain scans without tumors.

**Requirements**

To run this project, you need the following libraries:
Python 3.8+
PyTorch
torchvision
scikit-learn
matplotlib
numpy
PIL
ignite

Run this to install all dependencies
pip install torch torchvision scikit-learn matplotlib numpy pillow ignite
